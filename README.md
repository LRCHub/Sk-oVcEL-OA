[00:29.65] I'm just laying on the floor again
[00:33.91] Can't be bothered to get up now
[00:37.25] I wouldn't care
[00:39.09] If I never get up again
[00:42.03] I don't want to
[00:49.53] 
[00:48.36] Then our song comes on the radio
[00:52.85] Makes me wanna start to dance
[00:55.40] Oh, I wanna know
[00:57.53] If you feel the same way as me
[01:00.96] Why would you go?
[01:09.46] 
[01:06.28] Dancing, I'm all alone
[01:10.06] Figuring out how I can get you home
[01:15.66] Dancing with my phone
[01:19.20] Thinking about you
[01:28.20] 
[01:25.97] On my feet and now I'm out the door
[01:30.63] Walking by the places that we used to go
[01:34.90] I remember all your favorite stores
[01:38.58] I won't lie
[01:44.08] 
[01:44.26] I don't think I even know myself anymore
[01:53.43] You're the one who knew me fuckin' well
[01:59.60] Yeah, you know
[02:06.60] 
[02:02.95] Dancing, I'm all alone
[02:06.41] Figuring out how I can get you home
[02:12.07] Dancing with my phone
[02:15.72] Thinking about you
[02:24.72] 
[02:21.37] Dancing I'm all alone
[02:25.48] Figuring out how I can get you home
[02:31.19] Dancing with my phone
[02:34.37] Thinking about you
[02:43.37] 
[02:40.50] Dancing all alone
[02:42.43] Dancing all alone (I'm dancing all alone)
[02:45.12] Dancing all alone
[02:47.21] Dancing all alone (I'm dancing with my phone)
[02:49.99] Dancing with my phone
[02:53.20] Thinking about you
[03:02.20] 
[02:59.45] Dancing all alone
[03:01.15] Dancing all alone
[03:03.85] Dancing all alone
[03:06.05] Dancing all alone (thinking about you)
[03:08.99] Dancing with my phone
[03:12.23] Thinking about you
